## üîÆ Reflections for each assignment

- **Assignment 1**: Industry Talk Poster üñºÔ∏è
In this PETRONAS industry talk, I learned that Data Engineering involves designing and building systems to collect, store, and analyze data. I also gained insights into different roles, such as Data Analysts who analyze data, and Data Engineers who integrate data. PETRONAS supports engineers by providing training and hands-on projects to improve their skills. This talk helped me understand the importance of data engineering in business decisions and growth. 

- **Assignment 2**: Industry Visit Video üé•  
The industry visit helped us understand the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in the industry.

- **Assignment 3**: Report 
After attending the talk, I realized the importance of balancing technical and soft skills in building a successful career in computer science. Over the next four years, I aim to strengthen my foundation in programming, algorithms, and system design while actively participating in workshops and hackathons to gain practical experience. Besides, I will also improve my communication skills and collaboration. By staying committed to continuous learning and growth, I am confident in preparing for a successful future in the field. 

- **Assignment 4**: Newspaper
I have gained valuable insights into the transformative role of emerging technologies in agriculture. I‚Äôve learned how concepts like precision farming, automated machinery, and predictive analytics are revolutionizing the industry. By integrating AI, IoT, and robotics, I‚Äôve come to appreciate how these innovations help farmers improve efficiency, conserve resources, and reduce risks. This knowledge has expanded my understanding of how technology can drive smarter and more sustainable practices. It‚Äôs inspiring to see how these advancements can empower farmers, and I‚Äôm excited to apply this knowledge in future projects.
